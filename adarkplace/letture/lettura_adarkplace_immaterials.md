***What is***

A physical data visualization of the wi-fi traffic shown only through long exposure photos

***How it works***

The system is based is a portable device that detects the wi-fi traffic in every position during the walking and turn on and off sections of a vertical strip of blinking lights based on the intensity of the signal.
The final *product* can only be seen when long exposure photos of the walk are taken revealing a *graph* of the signal intensity.

***What does it mean***

It means that maybe in every place there's something to tell and to see, that we are constantly connected and that everything emits and receive data from something else.

***What if***

We use this *system* to make visuals like scripts and images that only time (long exposure photos) can shows.
