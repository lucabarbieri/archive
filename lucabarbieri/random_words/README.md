Noah Wardrip-Fruin identifies the British computer scientist Christopher Strachey as the creator of the rst work of electronic literature, a series of “love letters” generated by the Ferranti Mark I computer at Manchester University in 1952 (Wardrip-Fruin 2005). Affectionately known as M.U.C., the Manchester University Computer could produce the evocative *love letters* at a pace of one per minute, for hours on end, without producing a duplicate. The “trick” is, as Strachey put it, the two model sentences (e.g., “My adjective noun adverb verb your adjective noun” and “You are my adjective noun”) in which the nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are randomly selected from a list of words Strachey had culled from Roget’s Thesaurus. Adverbs and adjectives randomly drop out of the sentence as well, and the computer randomly alternates the two sentences. On the whole, Strachey is dismissive of his foray into the literary use of computers, using the example of the love letters simply to illustrate his point that simple rules can 
generate diverse and unexpected results
